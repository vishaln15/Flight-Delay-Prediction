# Flight-Delay-Prediction
Around $40 billion is the estimated economic loss, thanks to Flight delays. This repository contains the code for a two staged (pipelined) machine learning model which classifies the flights are delayed or otherwise and then predicts the delay in minutes using regression. The model uses weather forecast dataset and the flight dataset.
In an effort to cut costs and keeping in mind the comfort of passengers, this model hopefully helps to reduce the delay prediction of flights and thereby the delay itself. Feel free to check it out!
